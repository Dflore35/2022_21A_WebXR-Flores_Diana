# WebXRNASACapstone
This project is an informative experience that lets the user understand why the Psyche mission is important and what we are hoping to discover by visiting Psyche.

I learned how to program in A-Frame using glitch.com. I also received help from my team members. This project was made by Diana Flores and Co-Author Micah Schmidt. I pushed the finished prototype here on GitHub pages.

I got the text directly from the ASU NASA website. The Earth picture was created by my team member Thom Kim. The background stary picture was downloaded for free. I got it from  Kai Pilger on Unsplash. The Psyche asteriod model was also made by Thom Kim. 

You can run the code here on GitHub pages or you can download all the files. Once downloaded just click on the html file and it should start. Make sure all files are in the same folder. 

This project works on both Android and Iphone phones.
